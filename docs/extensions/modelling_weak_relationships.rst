Modelling Weak Relationships
============================

    In a relational database, a weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely
    identified by its attributes alone; therefore, it must use a foreign key in
    conjunction with its attributes to create a primary key. The foreign key is
    typically a primary key of an entity it is related to.
