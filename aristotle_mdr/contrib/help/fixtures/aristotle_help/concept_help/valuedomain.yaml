    brief: A valid pairing of an [[object class]] and a [[property]] to define a measurable
        attribute of the object, idea or event being observed.

        Concept that is an association of a [[Property]] with an [[Object Class]]

    body: >
        <p>A data element concept represents the union of an [[objectclass]] and a
        [[property]]. Examples of data element concepts include concepts such as,
        <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>date of birth</em>, <em>Person</em> &mdash;
        <em>country of birth</em>, and <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>religious
        affiliation</em>.</p>
        
        <p>A data element concept is solely a conceptual description
        and does not include values for measurement or collection.
        Values are described by a [[valuedomain]], which in combination with
        the data element concept forms a [[dataelement]].</p>
        
        <p>A [[conceptualdomain]] may also be associated with a data element concept,
        thereby providing meaning to the values associated with the concept.
        A one-to-many relationship may be formed between a data element concept
        and suitable conceptual domains.</p>

    brief: A definition of how to record the measurement a particular attribute, either
        using a coded list of values or a description of the possible values.
    offical_definition: a set of Permissible Values
    official_reference: ISO/IEC 11179 - Clause 3.2.140
    official_link: 
    body: >
        <p>A value domain provides a set of permissible values by which a [[data element]]
        can be implemented. Value domains can be enumerated (e.g. Total centimetres NNN)
        or non-enumerated (e.g. Sex code N).</p>
        
            <p>The union of a specific value domain with a specific [[data element concept]]
            creates a [[data element]]. For example the data element concept
            <em>Person&mdash;body height</em> can be implemented through union
            with the <em>Total centimetres NNN</em> value domain. </p>
        
        <h2>Permissable values</h2>
        {% include "aristotle_mdr/helpers/iso_quote.html" with quote="an expression of a Value Meaning allowed in a specific Value Domain" %}
        <h2>Enumerated vs non-enumerated value domains</h2>
        
        <p>ISO/IEC 11179 allows for 2 different types of Value Domains - enumerated vs non-enumerated.
        The distinction between these is that an enumerated value domain is <q>specified by a list of all its Value Meanings</q>,
        while a non-enumerated value domain is <q>specified by a description rather than a list of all Permissible Values</q>.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>An example of a enumerated value domain</em> would be a list of 10-year cohorts for recording a persons age:
                <ul>
                    <li> A code of A coresponsing to 0-15 years
                    <li> A code of B coresponsing to 15-30 years
                    <li> A code of C coresponsing to 30-45 years
                    <li> A code of D coresponsing to 45+ years
                </ul>
                Here, every possible value within the set has been explicitly enumerated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>An example of a non-enumerated value domain</em> would be an numeric range for recording a persons age,
                where the number could be any two digit number greater than zero. While there is an implied set of values, these have not been expressly enumerated.
