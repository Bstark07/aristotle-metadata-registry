{% block definition %}
    <p>An object class represents a person, organisation, structure or event that
    is of interest and needs to be described.  Examples of object classes include
    <em>Person, Dwelling</em> and <em>Family</em>.</p>

    <p>The union of a specific object class with a specific property creates a data
    element concept. For example, some of the above mentioned object classes can be
    combined with an <em>Religious affiliation</em> property to create the data
    element concepts: <em>Person &mdash; religious affiliation</em> and <em>Family
    &mdash; religious affiliation</em>.</p>

    <p>Object classes can be specialisations of other object classes.  For example,
    <em>Adult</em> is an age group related specialisation of <em>Person</em>.</p>

    <p>Specialisations allow object classes to be grouped and subtyped in a
    meaningful manner and help users in browsing and locating relevant object
    classes. In a specialisation tree an object class can only be associated with a
    single parent object class but may have more than one child object classes. A
    child object class inherits all characteristics of its parent object class, but
    a child object class may have unique characteristics.</p>
