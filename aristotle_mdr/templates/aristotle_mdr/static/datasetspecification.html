the scope statement. The data elements must be collected according to the specified guidelines, and may require the end user
to comply with specified sequencing, conditionality, and the total number of occurrences for each data element to be followed 
by the end user.</P> 

<P>Data set specifications may also be associated with other item types such as glossary items or indicators.</P>
