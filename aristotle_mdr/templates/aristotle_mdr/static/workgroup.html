<p>
<strong>A workgroup is an administrative collection of people working together
to create a set of metadata for a specific purpose.</strong>
</p>

<p>Every item belongs to a workgroup, and this workgroup is used to determine the
<a href="{% url 'aristotle:help' 'how_does_content_become_visible' %}">permissions
around when and to whom an item is visible.</a>
However, once an item is registered it become the property of the registry,
rather than just the workgroup.
</p>

<p>Workgroups usually have one or more <a href="{% url 'aristotle:about' 'registration_authorities' %}">registration authorities</a>
associated with them, and the workgroup is presumed to be creating content on behalf of these registraion authorities.
If a workgroup has no registration authority associated with it registration of items is not possible and items
will be visible only to members of the workgroup and cannot be <a href="{% url 'aristotle:help' 'what_is_a_standard' %}">standardised</a>.
</p>

{% if user.is_active %}
<p>Every workgroup has a discussion group associated with it, that is accessible
via your <a href="{% url 'aristotle:userHome' %}">dashboard</a>.</p>
