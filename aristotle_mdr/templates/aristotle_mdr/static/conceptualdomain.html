A concept that expresses its description or valid instance meanings.

{% block definition %}

<P>A conceptual domain may be associated with either a data element concept or a value domain. A conceptual domain is not a
mandatory association, and there may be a one-to-many relationship between a data element concept and a conceptual domain, or
a value domain and a conceptual domain.</P>

<P>Countries of the world can be expressed as a conceptual domain. The concept of countries can be measured by both enumerated
and non-enumerated value domains. An enumerated value domain may reference the Australian Standard Classification of Countries
(2011) and provide a four digit code (i.e. NNNN). A non-enumerated value domain may still reference the same classification,
but collect country names using a textual field instead (i.e Text X[X(99)]. Both the enumerated and non-enumerated value domains could be
associated with the conceptual domain for countries. The conceptual domain might also be associated with several data element
concepts which incorporate country as a central theme, such as <em>Person</em> &mdash;<em>country of birth</em>,
<em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>country of residence</em>, or <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>country of citizenship</em>.</P>
