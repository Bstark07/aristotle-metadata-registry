<header>Tips for creating good Properties:</header>
Properties are specific <em>attributes</em> from things we wish to collect information about.
Good names for properties are short, descriptive nouns.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Be generic:</strong> A property should apply to all members of an Object Class</li>
  <li><strong>Properties are unitless:</strong> They should be describe some aspect of a thing, without prescribing how that aspect is measured.
  For example, <em>height</em> is an attribute of all people regardless of how it is measured.
  </li>
  <!--  <li><strong>:</strong></li> -->
</ul>

If you are unsure, use the name of your object class in the contexts below.
<ul>
  <li>Measure of the age of <em>noun.</em></li>
  <li>Comparing the yearly income of <em>nouns</em> and private companies</li>
</ul>
In these examples, <q>Comparing the yearly income of <em>Persons</em> and private companies</q> makes sense,
but <q>Measure of the age of <em>Wages.</em></q> does not - wages is an attribute of people or businesses.
