<header>Tips for creating good Object Classes:</header>
Object classes are <em>things</em> we wish to collect information about.
Good names for object classes are short, descriptive nouns.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Be generic:</strong> An object class should apply to the widest group possible.
  Only make more specific classes, if there are particular attributes only found on the specialisation.
  e.g. Person, not Australian Citizens</li>
  <li><strong>Use singlar forms:</strong> When discusing individuals, use singular terms to ensure unambiguity. For example, a <em>Person</em> can have an age, but a <em>Group of people</em> has an average age.</li>
  <!--  <li><strong>:</strong></li> -->
</ul>

<!--
If you are unsure, use the name of your object class in the contexts below.
<ul>
  <li>Measure of the age of <em>noun.</em></li>
  <li>Comparing the yearly income of <em>nouns</em> and private companies</li>
</ul>
In these examples, <q>Comparing the yearly income of <em>Persons</em> and private companies</q> makes sense,
but <q>Measure of the age of <em>Wages.</em></q> does not - wages is an attribute of people or businesses.-->
